Following the **Ubiquitous Language** approach of Domain-Driven Design (DDD), this glossary is organized by sub-domains and contains simplified definitions gathered from domain experts. Its purpose is to establish a clear and consistent vocabulary, essential for effective communication and development of the application.

## ⚡ Energy Production
**Inverter**: A machine that produces energy using solar panels. It may have one or multiple MPPT and It can be on-grid or off-grid.
    
**MPPT**: *Maximum Power Point Tracking* is an hardware component, often already included into the invertes, that aims to optimize the energy from the solar panels
    
**Solar panel**: Hardware piece that produce energy from the sun.
    
**Inverter On-Grid**: An inverter that is physically connected to the national electrical grid
    
**Inverter Off-Grid**: An inverter that is not connected to the national electrical grid and it uses batteries
    
**Battery**: An hardware piece that stores energy
    
**Battery SoC**: *State of Charge* of the battery, it represents the total amount of energy stored in the battery
    
**Battery Discarge**: The process by which the energy come out of the battery
    
**Battery Charge**: The process by which the energy come into the battery
    
**Not used energy**:
- *On the On-Grid systems* it is the energy not used by the loads that it is feeded to the national electric grid.
- *On the Off-Grid system* it is the energy not produced by the system because it is not required by the loads
    
**Loads**: They are the devices that use energy
    

## ⛏️​ Mining
**Hashrate**: Measurement of the computing power of a miner
    
**Miner**: A machine that uses electrical energy to solve mathematical calculations and produce heat
    
**Energy consumption**: The electrical energy used by the miner
    
**Core temperatures**: The temperature of the main chips
    
**Efficiency**: The power consumption related to the produced hashrate
